                        <p>Cocoon isn’t just any other preschool – it’s a fun-school! We believe in holistic education, and
                            offer a strong and sustainable foundation for your child, so that turn into happy and
                            well-balanced adults later in life. </p>
                        <p>We cater to the tender age group of 1.5 to 5.5 years. At Cocoon, we’ve blended the ancient
                            Gurukulam system with the best of Montessori practices to impart an integrated education that
                            fosters learning. </p>
                        <p>We firmly believe that happy children make successful learners and provide a safe and secure
                            environment that nurtures their innate curiosity.</p>

                        <p class="text-justify">Every child is unique, and they ought to be treated that way! We do this by
                            allowing children to grow into their authentic selves and encourage them to develop at their own
                            pace. Through play, we learn! A huge XX sq. Feet campus with plenty of greenery and
                            indoor/outdoor play equipment ensures that your child gets to explore nature and learn about the
                            world around them. From catching a butterfly to learning about colours through flowers, there’s
                            so much that a child can learn! Spending time in nature is one of the best ways to build
                            cognitive skills, claim researchers! Of course, they’re always closely monitored by our
                            experienced and well-trained staff! </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">We believe in cultivating a child’s inquisitiveness. Our curriculum is
                            balanced so that children are familiar with routine but are still offered plenty of
                            opportunities for spontaneity through play, activity, and exploration. </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">We believe in the ability of children to discover new things, interact,
                            socialize, and learn through new activities and experiences.</p>

                        <p class="text-justify">We value parents as the primary educators of a child and work with them to

                        <p class="text-justify">Open house meetings are arranged every month so that parents can meet

                        <p class="text-justify">We also have a close-knit parents’ network which helps arrange social events

                        <h4><br></h4>
                        <p class="text-justify">We approach early education with the belief that when children are happy and
                            given the freedom to explorethey develop confidence, and independence.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">Children are grouped into classes with other children in the same academic
                            year and stay in these small groupsuntil they leave for Primary School. &nbsp;Each class is led
                            by an experienced teacher and there will be up to 15children in the class during a session.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">This approach helps children build relationships with their peers and
                            teachers. &nbsp;It also facilitates effectivecommunication between the parents and teacher, as
                            parents know exactly who is responsible for their child'slearning and development at the
                            nursery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">Art, exercise, imagination, communication, language and science are the key
                            areas of education we aim tofocus on at Cocoon. Teachers encourage children to become expressive
                            in their communication throughoutthe school day.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">Our classrooms are designed to encourage thinking and problem-solving skills
                            in children. The rooms are spacious enough to allow children to move freely between tables.
                            Indoor toys include puzzles, word-play sets, alphabet-blocks, and other games. </p>
                        <p class="text-justify"><b>Active-Learning:</b> Teacher-led activities include phonics, math,
                            handwriting, identifying alphabets, etc. </p>
                        <p class="text-justify"><b>Katha Neram:</b> A well-stocked kiddie-library includes dozens of
                            children’s books for storytelling and fact-finding. We aim to develop a love for literature
                            early on in their lives, through group stories and one-to-one reading.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">The Cocoon garden within our 21780 Sqft. campus, includes a wide array of
                            plants and trees. This, we believe, is the best learning environment any child could ask for! It
                            helps develop self-efficacy in children – facilitating social and emotional skills, encouraging
                            risk-taking, and ensuring physical development. We recognize the importance of outside play in
                            early child development and encouraged them to be close to nature. </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">The beauty of nature is that we receive far more than we give! And that is
                            why, at Cocoon, our children are taught to nurture plants. We also have a small vegetable patch
                            where they get to plant seedlings, water the sprouts, take care of the plant, and finally enjoy
                            the yield. This helps them understand life cycles, respect nature, and even avoid a picky-eater
                            situation. </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">At Cocoon, we celebrate all festivals with a lot of fun and enthusiasm to
                            help children stay connected to their roots and understand the true meaning behind each
                            festival. </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">For lunch, we recommend everything from beetroot to broccoli. Teachers
                            encourage all children to share and care, whenever possible. </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">Teaching isn’t just about the curriculum; it must also impart life-skills.
                            And that is why we encourage children to look after themselves and their friends by helping
                            adults with activities like setting the table, queuing, and helping with the washing up at snack
                            and lunchtimes. </p>
